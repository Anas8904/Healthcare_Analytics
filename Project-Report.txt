üè• Project Report: Healthcare Analytics

1. Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of healthcare data to uncover patterns and trends related to patient outcomes, hospital performance, and disease prevalence. It aims to generate actionable insights for healthcare providers and stakeholders to optimize clinical processes and improve patient care.

2. Data Description
Source: Publicly available healthcare dataset (e.g., patient records, treatment outcomes, demographics, etc.).

Key Variables:

Patient demographics (age, gender, location)
Diagnosis and treatment details
Outcome metrics (e.g., recovery time, readmission, mortality)
Hospital-related attributes (department, length of stay, costs)

3. Data Cleaning & Exploration

Missing Values: Identified and imputed missing entries using appropriate strategies (mean imputation for numeric, mode for categorical).
Outliers Handling: Detected anomalies via IQR method and either removed or transformed them.
Duplicates: Removed duplicated patient or record entries.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution analysis of demographic variables
Correlation heatmaps for numeric health indicators
Aggregated statistics (mean length of stay, readmission rates by age group)

4. Feature Engineering

Created new variables to enhance predictive modeling:
Age groups (e.g.,‚ÄØ0‚Äì18,‚ÄØ19‚Äì40,‚ÄØ41‚Äì65,‚ÄØ66+)
Readmission flags (binary)
Cost per day (total cost divided by length of stay)
Comorbidity count (number of co-existing conditions)

5. Modeling & Analysis

Applied machine learning algorithms to predict key outcomes:

Model	Purpose	Metrics
Logistic Regression	Predict patient readmission risk	Accuracy, AUC
Random Forest	Capture complex patterns	Precision, Recall
XGBoost	Boosted-tree model for high accuracy	F1-score, AUC

Model Evaluation:

80/20 train-test split
Cross-validation for performance stability
ROC curves and confusion matrices visualized

6. Key Findings & Insights

Certain age groups and comorbidities significantly increased readmission risk.
Hospitals with shorter average length of stay had lower cost-per-day but occasionally higher readmission rates.
Model comparisons showed XGBoost delivered the best balance with an AUC of ~0.88, outperforming Logistic Regression (~0.82) and Random Forest (~0.85).
